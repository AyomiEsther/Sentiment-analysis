# Sentiment-analysis

For this project, I conducted a sentiment analysis to determine the de-mystifying emotions expressed by users within brand mentions of an E-commerce female clothing brand customers according to the review of their customers, such as positive, negative, and neutral.

The data used for this assignment was extracted from Kaggle. Here are a few things I wanted to find out about the brand’s customers: 
Customer’s opinions about the brand product and service 
How customers and social media followers perceive the products
The reputation your company has in the business

I analyzed the customer reviews based on sentiments, Instead of sorting through this data manually, I used sentiment analysis to automatically understand what customers thought about the female clothing brand, got insights for data-driven decisions to automate business processes

This analysis was helpful in;

Analyzing product reviews to quickly get insights into what the customers like and dislike about their product
Analyzing real-time feedback to detect angry customers and act accordingly to prevent churn
Analyzing review to perform competitive research
